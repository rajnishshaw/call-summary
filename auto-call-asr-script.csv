agent,I understand. Let's take a look at how we can help make your day better. Are you calling about a specific issue with your vehicle?
caller,Yes....I recently had some work done and now there's an engine light on.
agent,Okay....I apologize for the frustration. Can you provide some more details about the work that was done and any symptoms you've noticed since the engine light came on? That will help me troubleshoot the issue.
agent,Alright....based on the information provided....it sounds like the recent service may not have fully resolved the problem. I'd like to create a service appointment for you so our technicians can take another look and properly diagnose and repair the issue.
agent,When is a good day and time for you to bring your vehicle in? I have an opening tomorrow at 10am or Thursday at 2pm. Which works best for you?
caller,Thursday at 2pm works for me.
agent,Perfect....I have you scheduled for Thursday at 2pm. When you arrive....just let the service advisor know you spoke with me about the engine light being on after recent service. Please let me know if anything changes or if you have any other questions in the meantime!
caller,Sounds good....thanks for your help!
agent,You're welcome! We look forward to seeing you Thursday and getting this fixed up for you. Have a great rest of your day!
